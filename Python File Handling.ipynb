This is quite helpful in storing data for future use.\n","* Python too provides several features to perform various operations on disk files using built-in funtions.\n","* The **open()** methods is the key method that is used to open a file on a disk for various operations.\n","\n","#### Opening data files\n","\n","* Python generaly saves the created datafiles in the same location where the related python scripts are stored. However we can decide a different location for datafile storage depending on application needs.\n","* Python uses various modes for opeing a datafile\n","* The **open()** returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: **open(filename, mode)**.\n","* There are four different modes for opening a data file\n","    * \"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n","    * \"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist. Does not eraase previous data\n","    * \"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist. Erases previous data\n","    * \"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n","    \n","* In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode\n","    * \"t\" - Text - Default value. Text mode\n","    * \"b\" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)\n","    \n","* We also can open a file using the following modes\n","    * \"r+\" - Random access in text files (First read and then write)\n","    * \"r+b\" or \"rb+\" - Random access in binary files\n","    * \"w+\" and \"w+b\" - Similar to above but previous data gets erased"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HKxVWZmwKJ3n"},"source":["### Using Google Drive to perform Data File handling operations\n","* Type the following code to authenticate and access yur drive for data file storage"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mMceKHD2IPxA","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"20b19b1b-286e-497d-97e8-eb009f37f3a8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736735257599,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1763,"user":{"displayName":"Xunyu Chen","userId":"01633272974123394445"}}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/drive')\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XOM1T1cMMoOs"},"source":["#### Opening a datafile for writing\n","\n","\n","* In the following example we are going to use the **'w'** mode with **open()** function to create a data file **data.txt** in the location\n","* When we use the **w** mode a new file is created that replaces the previous file and now we can use the **write()** function write in to the file.\n","* The write() function writes strings (or a set of ASCII charecters) in the file, which we can see by double clicking the file at its location.\n","* After writing it is mandatory to close the file handle by using the **close()** function.\n","* The two functions write() and close() are member functions to the **file** object created by us."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YIHEExUmLEUp"},"source":["file = open('/drive/My Drive/Teaching/2025 Spring/INFO 617/Lecture 1 Jan 13/Test.txt','w')\n","file.write('Hello Students\\n')\n","file.write('Welcome to INFO 617')\n","file.close()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"driUMazzNRqz"},"source":["### Opening the file for reading\n","\n","* Now we are going to open it in python environment for reading by using the **r** mode or the default mode.
